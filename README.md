# Syberia The World Before Fix

This MelonLoader mod for the game **Syberia (4): The World Before** adds support for:
- Playing the game in any ultrawide aspect ratio such as 21:9, 32:9 or even higher.
- Fixing various UI issues caused by running at unsupported resolutions.
- Setting an arbitrary resolution.

## Installation
- Grab the [latest version of the MelonLoader installer](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe)
- Run it and click **SELECT**, then navigate to the **game directory** (e.g steamapps/common/Syberia - The World Before).
- Find and open the game executable (**SyberiaTWB.exe**) and click **INSTALL**.
- Grab the [latest release of SyberiaTWBFix](https://github.com/Lyall/SyberiaTWBFix/releases)
